Hi Rafael,
 
Thank you again for joining me this afternoon for the Application Developer interview.
 
Below is the Front-End Development assessment that I mentioned at the end of our meeting. Please complete by end of day Thursday, December 21st and send me the link to your code files and hosted application. You can email me with any questions or concerns as you work on this assessment.
 
Thank you Rafael!
 
------------------ FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT ------------------
 
This assessment was created to evaluate your front-end development skills, as well as your creativity and attention to detail.
 
Create an application to view all customers of a company and to add new ones. This application will be used by employees of the company and will use a Mock API with randomly generated data.

You are required to use Bootstrap. You can optionally use any combination of JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, Angular, React, or Vue.
All development should be done client-side.
It should work in both mobile and desktop browsers.
You are free to use any colors, animations, etc. that you think would be aesthetically pleasing and beneficial to the application’s purpose.
Mock API
Get All Customers (GET)
URL: https://my.api.mockaroo.com/customers.json?key=03c46990
This always returns a random list of 100 customers in the following data sturcture:

[
    {
        "customer_number": 53165,
        "first_name": "Lionel",
        "last_name": "Storey",
        "date_birth": "01/28/1948",
        "ssn": "646-70-1743",
        "email": "lstorey0@mysql.com",
        "primary_address": {
            "address_line_1": "82 Forster Road",
            "city": "Shawnee Mission",
            "state": "KS",
            "zip_code": 61853
        },
        "mobile_phone_number": "913-700-4338",
        "join_date": "05/03/2012"
    },
    {
        "customer_number": 94087,
        "first_name": "Dolorita",
        "last_name": "Arthan",
        "date_birth": "04/24/2009",
        "ssn": "859-90-0524",
        "email": "darthan1@nationalgeographic.com",
        "primary_address": {
            "address_line_1": "67308 Walton Alley",
            "city": "Littleton",
            "state": "CO",
            "zip_code": 17261
        },
        "mobile_phone_number": "303-689-9152",
        "join_date": "04/11/2014"
    },
    {
        "customer_number": 24319,
        "first_name": "Joseito",
        "last_name": "McAteer",
        "date_birth": "06/14/2004",
        "ssn": "708-86-0230",
        "email": "jmcateer2@fda.gov",
        "primary_address": {
            "address_line_1": "12 Quincy Circle",
            "city": "Aurora",
            "state": "CO",
            "zip_code": 75601
        },
        "mobile_phone_number": "303-516-3364",
        "join_date": "02/07/2023"
    },...
]

You can pass an optional size parameter to limit the number of results.
Example: https://my.api.mockaroo.com/customers.json?key=03c46990&size=5
Create Customer (POST)
URL: https://my.api.mockaroo.com/customers.json?key=03c46990
This always returns a 201 status.
This is not a real API so no customer is actually created. You can assume the request was successful. Once you receive the response, add the customer to the current view.
All Customers View
Display the information below for all customers.


Customer number (five digit random number)
First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth
Last 4 of SSN
Age (calculated from Date of Birth)


For each customer, the user should be able to view some additional information (listed below) in a popover or similar view.
Email address
Primary address
Mobile phone number
Join date (when they became customers of the company)


Create New Customer View
Create a link to display a form that will allow the user to create a new customer with the information below. Once the user clicks “Submit,” they will see the “All Customers“ view again. Validate all fields before and on submission.
Customer number (five digit random number)
First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth
SSN
Email address
Primary address
Mobile phone number
You can make any required assumptions if something was not specified in this document. We also encourage you to be creative and make changes to any UI specifications above if you believe you have a better solution.
Please use GitHub to share your code files and you can choose your preferred method (GitHub, your portfolio site, etc.) to host the application so that we can test it. For security reasons, we are unable to run the application locally, which is why we require for it to be hosted externally.
